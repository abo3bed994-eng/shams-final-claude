// Platform-resolved Firebase data layer — NATIVE (iOS/Android) implementation.
//
// Metro picks this file over `fb.ts` on native builds. It is backed by
// @react-native-firebase so Firestore/Storage share the SAME native auth
// session created by phone sign-in (@react-native-firebase/auth). This is the
// fix for native writes failing with "تعذّر الحفظ": the Firebase JS SDK auth
// state never reaches the native session, so JS-SDK Firestore writes ran
// unauthenticated and were rejected by the security rules.
